## Welcome to Next House!

With over 350 residents, we are one of the largest and friendliest dorms on campus. We are a group of easy-going people who like to hang out, have fun, and enjoy our time together here at MIT.

Situated right on the banks of the Charles River, Next offers stunning views of the riverfront, downtown Boston, Fenway, and the infamous CITGO sign. The first floor contains our Tastefully Furnished Lounge and our dining hall - offering daily breakfast and dinner. For those who like to keep in shape - we have well-equipped weight and cardio rooms, for those who like music - a music room, and for those who like to launder - a laundry room. For the chefs among us we have a spectacular kitchen. We also have a pool table, ping-pong tables, foosball, an ever-expanding collection of DVD's, as well as an Athena cluster.
