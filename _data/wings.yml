  description: 2E is a smorgasbord of good times, from Pizza Boiz to 5:30 dinner club, spontaneous boba runs, secret Santa, a wing-wide Assassins game, and just plain old camaraderie. We feel that two aspects help us stand out: firstly, we are extremely close-knit; and secondly, we love celebrating individuality.

Our favorite pastimes include theatre, salsa, card and board games, Domino's and Overwatch.

  description: Welcome to 5W, the farthest wing of the farthest dorm, and the best wing of the best house. Here you can chill in the lounge with friends or go out hiking on the weekends. Make your own late night coffee and hot chocolate, and play movies on the big screen whenever you like using our wing projector.
