  description: Next Haunt creates and operates a real-life haunted escape the room game for the MIT community during Halloween season. It features physical adventures in which groups are locked in a room and must use elements in the room to solve a series of puzzles, find clues, and escape the room within a set time limit. Nexties design the house and the puzzles, build it, paint it, polish it, organize actors, and make sure runs happen. Join us for a truly sp0oOky adventure right in a house within Next House.

  description: Next Act is our annual, student-run musical. Every year, we transform our huge tastefully furnished lounge (TFL) on the first floor into an awesome theater, and put on a great show for CPW. Everyone in the show - including the actors, actresses, prod staff, and pit orchestra - are students from Next and all around campus. There's a wide range of experience levels, too - for some it's their first time being in a show, while others have been in so many shows it's hard to keep count! Next Act is open to everyone, and it's sure to be a lot of fun.
