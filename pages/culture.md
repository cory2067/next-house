We're interested in anything and everything! You're sure to find other people in Next with similar interests as you - whether it be playing a varsity sport or just going for a casual run, playing in MIT's best musical ensembles or just jamming in the music room, acting, singing, playing board and video games, building cool techy projects, doing recreational math, sleeping (sometimes...), cooking, or eating - we do it all!

But, despite our huge range of interests, the one thing that we all have in common is that we love to have fun, and we're friendly and engaging!

To learn more about what it means to be a Next House resident, please take a look at our [Community Standards Handbook][handbook]. To see what we're up to, check out our [Next Exec Meeting Minutes][minutes].

## Wings

Next house is composed of 8 wings, a Western wing and an Eastern wing on each of the floors 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Some wing's pages are currently under construction. Please check back later for those.

## Social

Next is one of the most social dorms on campus! We have regular study
breaks (such as **coffeehouse**) and social events so you can take a
break from those psets, an **annual fall formal** so you can dance
away, and an annual **ski trip** so you can breeze down a snowy
mountain (...or tumble on your behind, if you've never been skiing
before). Some other big social events that we've had include wing
competitions, Next Island, Mardi Gras, and **Next Big Party**.

But that's just part of the story - just walk through any wing of Next
in the evening and you'll find a hustle-bustle of action. People will
be in lounges working on psets together - having a good time while
getting some work done. Others will be cooking, jamming in the music
room, watching TV, playing video games, or just chilling and having a
good time. It's these smaller, impromptu social gatherings that really
define the warmth and friendly atmosphere of Next.

There is also a 2008 iteration of the website, but unfortunately it hasn't been preserved well.
The version labeled *2016* was longest-surviving iteration of the website. Written in 2011
by Next resident Steve Levine, this version served Next House all the way until August 2017.

You can also view minutes from old Next Exec meetings, or as it was called back in the day, ExecCom.
Check out the 1996-1997 minutes [here](http://next.scripts.mit.edu/1999/execcom/). There are also some
2004 minutes on the ExecCom page of the 2004 website.

There's also an interesting i3 website, archived from 2012. You can find it [here](http://next.scripts.mit.edu/2012-i3/welcome.html).
