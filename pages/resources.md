Next House has many resources for students to access from the Residential Peer Mentors Program to our Area Director and Heads of House. All the members of the community are there to help and support students and specifically freshmen as they accustom to Next and the Institvte.

### Residential Peer Mentors

Next House is one of four dorms with the Residential Peer Mentor (RPM) Program. This means that in addition to being assigned a faculty advisor and associate advisor, you and other first year students living on your floor will also be paired with an upperclass Nextie who serves as your Peer Mentor. The Peer Mentors are here to be a resource and to help you in any way you may need while navigating your first year here at Next House and the Institute. You’ll hear from Next's Peer Mentors later this summer!

### Graduate Resident Tutors and Wing-Reps

GRTs are graduate residence tutors that live in each wing, ready to provide advice, throw awesome study breaks, and generally make your stay at Next House more enjoyable!

Each wing also elects one or more student wing-reps, who also help throw study breaks and generally make sure that the people in their wings are happy.

### The House Team

The Next House Team is made up of our RLAD (Residential Life Area Director) - Topher Nelson [tophern], our Heads of Houses, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero [pjarillo] and Empar Rollano-Hijarrubia [empar], and the GRTs of each wing.

### Next Exec

Next Exec is our student government. Exec is responsible for running the housing lotteries, planning social events and study breaks, managing finances, keeping in touch with alumni, and generally making sure Next House doesn't burn down. You can view Next Exec's [Constitution](/static/NextHouseConstitution2015.pdf) and [Bylaws](/static/NextHouseBylaws2016.pdf), which lays out their responsibilities and procedures.

I’ve also switched majors once, lived in a triple, and been involved in 4W and Next since my sophomore year, so feel free to flag me down and talk to me about anything! It doesn’t have to be Next- or MIT-related, but if it is, I’ll happily say, Next House, Best House! Welcome to our friendly and creative community.
