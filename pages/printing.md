To connect to the wing printers you **must** be connected to **MIT Secure**
or hooked up to ethernet. MIT Guest won't work.

## Printer Names
```
2E: justinbieber.mit.edu
2W: next2w.mit.edu
3E: nalgas.mit.edu
3W: printerbena.mit.edu
4E: fourest.mit.edu
4W: derp.mit.edu
5E: stirfry.mit.edu
5W: page-fault.mit.edu
```

## Connecting
On Windows, under *Devices and Printers* in the control panel, hit *Add a printer*, and then
*Add a network printer*. Click on the bottom, *The printer I want isn't listed*, and then
enter the above address for the printer you want. Drivers should be automatically installed.

On Mac, you should be able to add a new printer from *Print & Scan* under *System Preferences*.
When you add a new printer, go to the IP tab and then enter the above address for your printer.

If you use Linux, then I assume you already know how to set up a printer.
