To connect to the wing printers you **must** be connected to **MIT Secure**
or hooked up to ethernet. MIT Guest won't work.

## Printer Names
```
2E: justinbieber.mit.edu
2W: next2w.mit.edu
3E: nalgas.mit.edu
3W: printerbena.mit.edu
4E: fourest.mit.edu
4W: derp.mit.edu
5E: stirfry.mit.edu
5W: page-fault.mit.edu
```

## Connecting
On Windows, under *Devices and Printers* in the control panel, hit *Add a printer*, and then
*Add a network printer*. Click on the bottom, *The printer I want isn't listed*, and then
enter the above address for the printer you want. Drivers should be automatically installed.

On Mac, you should be able to add a new printer from *Print & Scan* under *System Preferences*.
When you add a new printer, go to the IP tab and then enter the above address for your printer.

If you use Linux, then I assume you already know how to set up a printer.

## Printing to the Athena Cluster
Paperjam is our main copier/scanner/printer, and is capable of printing in color.
One simple way to print with this is to bring a flash drive with your files and stick it
into the printer. You may need to log in to use this printer, but the account really doesn't matter.
So if you don't have an account, just log in with username *bamo*, and password *bamo*.
For more detailed instructions, [see here]({{ site.url }}/static/PaperjamInstructions.pdf).

We also have a B&W printer, *tree-eater* that you can print to via Pharos. For information about
Pharos printing, [see here](http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/istcontrib/Pharos+Public+Student+Printing+at+MIT).

## Issues
If any printer is running low on toner, doesn't connect, or has any other problems,
please email next-printer (at) mit (dot) edu.
