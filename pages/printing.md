To connect to the wing printers, you **must** be connected to `MIT Secure`
or hooked up via ethernet (which has a speed cap of around `10mbps`). `MIT Guest` won't work.

## Printer Names
```
2E: justinbieber.mit.edu
2W: next2w.mit.edu
3E: nalgas.mit.edu
3W: printerbena.mit.edu
4E: fourest.mit.edu
4W: derp.mit.edu
5E: stirfry.mit.edu
5W: page-fault.mit.edu
```

## Connecting
On Windows, under `Devices and Printers` in `Control Panel`, hit `Add a printer`, and then
`Add a network printer`. Click on the bottom, `The printer I want isn't listed`, and then
enter the above address for the printer you want. Drivers will automatically install.

On MacOS, add a new printer from `Printers & Scanners` under `System Preferences`.
When adding a new printer, go to the IP tab and enter the respective address above for your printer.

If you use Linux, then it is assumed that you know how to set up a printer.

## Printing to the Athena Cluster
`Paperjam` is our main copier/scanner/printer, capable of printing in color.
One simple way to print with this is to bring a flash drive with your files and plug it
into the printer. You may need to log in to use this printer, but the account really doesn't matter.
If you don't have an account, log in with username `bamo`, password `bamo`.
For more detailed instructions, [see here]({{ site.url }}/static/PaperjamInstructions.pdf).

We also have a B&W printer, `tree-eater`, which you can print to via Pharos. For information about
Pharos printing, [see here](http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/istcontrib/Pharos+Public+Student+Printing+at+MIT).

## Issues
If any printer is running low on toner, doesn't connect, or has any other problems, send an email to [next-printer@mit.edu](mailto:next-printer@mit.edu).
