To connect to the wing printers, you **must** be connected to `MIT Secure`
or hooked up via ethernet. `MIT Guest` may not work.

If you have issues with network printing, you can also print via USB (type B cable). Note: Your OS will probably list wired connection as a separate printer, so make sure you select the correct entry.

## Printer Names

## Connecting
On Windows, under `Devices and Printers` in `Control Panel`, hit `Add a printer`, and then
`Add a network printer`. Click on the bottom, `The printer I want isn't listed`, and then
enter the above address for the printer you want. Drivers will automatically install.

On MacOS, add a new printer from `Printers & Scanners` under `System Preferences`.
When adding a new printer, go to the IP tab and enter the respective address above for your printer.

If you use Linux, then it is assumed that you know how to set up a printer.

## Printing to the Athena Cluster
`Paperjam` is our main copier/scanner/printer, capable of printing in color.
One simple way to print with this is to bring a flash drive with your files and plug it
into the printer. To log in to the printer, use username `bamo`, password `bamo`.
For more detailed instructions, [see here]({{ site.url }}/static/PaperjamInstructions.pdf).

We also have a B&W printer, `tree-eater`, which you can print to via Pharos. For information about
Pharos printing, [see here](http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/istcontrib/Pharos+Public+Student+Printing+at+MIT).

## Issues
If any printer is running low on toner, doesn't connect, or has any other problems, send an email to [next-printer@mit.edu](mailto:next-printer@mit.edu).
